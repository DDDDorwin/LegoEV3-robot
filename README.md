## Project Overview

Robosistance is designed to enhance security measures through automation and robotics. The project is divided into three main components:

- **Frontend**: The user interface for monitoring and controlling Robosistance.
- **Backend**: The server-side logic that processes data and manages commands sent to and from the robot.
- **Robot Development**: The core of Robosistance, developed on the LEGO EV3 platform, includes motion control, obstacle detection, and other security features.

## Features

- Real-time video surveillance.
- Automated patrol routes.
- Obstacle avoidance and navigation.
- Remote control and monitoring via a web interface.
- Alert system for security breaches.

## Build Instructions

### Backend
#### Toolchain setup
##### Rust
Install the nightly toolchain.

`rustup toolchain install nightly`

Set the toolchain for the project.
**NOTE: This must be done in the `/robosistance` folder**

`rustup override set nightly`

##### MongoDB

Add a `.env` file to the robosistance folder with `MONGOURI=?` where `?` should be the database URI.

#### Building
Error checking.
